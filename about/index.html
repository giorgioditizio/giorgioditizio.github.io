I am a researcher at the University of Trento, Italy in the <a href='https://securitylab.disi.unitn.it/doku.php' target='_blank'>Security Research Group</a> under the supervision of <a href='https://disi.unitn.it/~massacci/' target='_blank'>Prof. Fabio Massacci</a>. Previous to that, I was fortunate enough to join the Information Security and Cryptography Group of <a href='https://www.infsec.cs.uni-saarland.de/~backes/' target='_blank'>Prof. Michael Backes</a> at <a href='https://cispa.saarland/' target='_blank'>CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security</a> in Saarbrücken, Germany and be supervised by Dr. Robert Künnemann. I received my B.Sc. in Information Engineering from the University of Brescia and my M.Sc. in Computer Science from the University of Trento in 2016 and 2018, respectively.

My main research interests lie within Network and System security. In particular, I work on topics regarding vulnerability analysis, malware analysis, and modeling malicious activities on the Internet.<br />
