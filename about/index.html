<h2>Hello!</h2>

I am a Ph.D. student under the supervision of <a href='https://disi.unitn.it/~massacci/' target='_blank'>Prof. Fabio Massacci</a> in the <a href='https://securitylab.disi.unitn.it/doku.php' target='_blank'>DISI Security Group</a> at the University of Trento, Italy. Prior to that, I was a research fellow at the DISI. During my master's degree, I joined the Information Security and Cryptography Group at <a href='https://cispa.saarland/' target='_blank'>CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security</a> in Saarbrücken, Germany, under the supervision of Dr. Robert Künnemann. I received my B.Sc. in information engineering from the University of Brescia, Italy, and my M.Sc. in computer science from the University of Trento in 2016 and 2018, respectively.
