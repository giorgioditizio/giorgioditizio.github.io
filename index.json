Due to the size of the forums and the domain expertise required to identify criminal discussions, most approaches employ supervised machine learning techniques to automatically classify the posts of interest. [Goal] Human annotation is costly. How to select samples to annotate that account for the structure of the forum? [Method] We present a methodology to generate stratified samples based on information about the centrality properties of the population and evaluate classifier performance. [Result] We observe that by employing a sample obtained from a uniform distribution of the post degree centrality metric, we maintain the same level of precision but significantly increase the recall (+30%) compared to a sample whose distribution is respecting the population stratification. We find that classifiers trained with similar samples disagree on the classification of criminal activities up to 33% of the time when deployed on the entire forum.","tags":null,"title":"A Graph-based Stratified Sampling Methodology for the Analysis of (Underground) Forums","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Fabio Massacci","Giorgio Di Tizio"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1671494400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1671494400,"objectID":"bf80571c7fdac80740f6cee8533a0831","permalink":"","publishdate":"2022-12-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"","section":"publication","summary":"Considering the conundrum of software updates","tags":null,"title":"Are Software Updates Useless against Advanced Persistent Threats?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Giorgio Di Tizio","Patrick Speicher","Milivoj Simeonovski","Michael Backes","Ben Stock","Robert Künnemann"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1664582400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1664582400,"objectID":"8b8f177bb8b741d41febf5d8773424bf","permalink":"","publishdate":"2022-10-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"","section":"publication","summary":"The integrity of the content a user is exposed to when browsing the web relies on a plethora of non-web technologies and an infrastructure of interdependent hosts, communication technologies, and trust relations. Incidents like the Chinese Great Cannon or the MyEtherWallet attack make it painfully clear: the security of end users hinges on the security of the surrounding infrastructure: routing, DNS, content delivery, and the PKI. There are many competing, but isolated proposals to increase security, from the network up to the application layer. So far, researchers have focus on analyzing attacks and defenses on specific layers. We still lack an evaluation of how, given the status quo of the web, these proposals can be combined, how effective they are, and at what cost the increase of security comes. In this work, we propose a graph-based analysis based on Stackelberg planning that considers a rich attacker model and a multitude of proposals from IPsec to DNSSEC and SRI. Our threat model considers the security of billions of users against attackers ranging from small hacker groups to nation-state actors. Analyzing the infrastructure of the Top 5k Alexa domains, we discover that the security mechanisms currently deployed are ineffective and that some infrastructure providers have a comparable threat potential to nations. We find a considerable increase of security (up to 13% protected web visits) is possible at relatively modest cost, due to the effectiveness of mitigations at the application and transport layer, which dominate expensive infrastructure enhancements such as DNSSEC and IPsec.","tags":null,"title":"Pareto-Optimal Defenses for the Web Infrastructure: Theory and Practice","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Giorgio Di Tizio","Michele Armellini","Fabio Massacci"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1652659200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1652659200,"objectID":"dd7e4596daf044878a56a179183c3c83","permalink":"","publishdate":"2022-05-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"","section":"publication","summary":"Software updates reduce the opportunity for exploitation. However, since updates can also introduce breaking changes, enterprises face the problem of balancing the need to secure software with updates with the need to support operations. We propose a methodology to quantitatively investigate the effectiveness of software updates strategies against attacks of Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs). We consider strategies where the vendor updates are the only limiting factors to cases in which enterprises delay updates from 1 to 7 months based on SANS data. Our manually curated dataset of APT attacks covers 86 APTs and 350 campaigns from 2008 to 2020. It includes information about attack vectors, exploited vulnerabilities (e.g. 0-days vs public vulnerabilities), and affected software and versions. Contrary to common belief, most APT campaigns employed publicly known vulnerabilities. If an enterprise could theoretically update as soon as an update is released, it would face lower odds of being compromised than those waiting one (4.9x) or three (9.1x) months. However, if attacked, it could still be compromised from 14% to 33% of the times. As in practice enterprises must do regression testing before applying an update, our major finding is that one could perform 12% of all possible updates restricting oneself only to versions fixing publicly known vulnerabilities without significant changes to the odds of being compromised compared to a company that updates for all versions.","tags":null,"title":"Software Updates Strategies: a Quantitative Evaluation against Advanced Persistent Threats","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Giorgio Di Tizio","Fabio Massacci"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609459200,"objectID":"b95ccaecfcd2e3a45afdec777e44b457","permalink":"","publishdate":"2021-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"","section":"publication","summary":"Online tracking techniques, the interactions among trackers, and the economic and social impact ofthese procedures in the advertising ecosystem have received increasing attention in the last years. This work proposes a novel formal model that describes the foundations on which the visible process of data sharing behaves in terms of the network configurations of the Internet (included CDNs, shared cookies, etc.). From our model, we define relations that can be used to evaluate the impact of different privacy mitigations and determine if websites should comply with privacy regulations. We show that the calculus, based on a fragment of intuitionistic logic, is tractable and constructive: any formal derivation in the model corresponds to an actual tracking practice that can be implemented given the current configuration of the Internet. We apply our model on a dataset obtained from OpenWPM to evaluate the effectiveness of tracking mitigations up to Alexa Top 100.","tags":null,"title":"A Calculus of Tracking: Theory and Practice","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Giorgio Di Tizio","Fabio Massacci","Luca Allodi","Stanislav Dashevskyi","Jelena Mirkovic"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1598918400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1598918400,"objectID":"e41fbf2a9d2fbe28685024ad1f0fed4b","permalink":"","publishdate":"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"","section":"publication","summary":"Current approaches to estimate the risk of compromise are based on either historical data or pure technical assessments, such as the number and severity of vulnerabilities in the target network.

Previous works mainly focused on large-scale analysis of the cryptojacking ecosystem, technical means to detect browser-based mining as well as economic incentives of cryptojacking. So far, no one has studied if certain technical characteristics of a website can increase (decrease) the likelihood of being compromised for cryptojacking campaigns. In this paper, we propose to address this unanswered question by conducting a case-control study with cryptojacking websites obtained crawling the web using Minesweeper. Our preliminary analysis shows some association for certain website characteristics, however, the results obtained are not statistically significant. Thus, more data must be collected and further analysis must be conducted to obtain a better insight into the impact of these relations.","tags":null,"title":"Are You a Favorite Target For Cryptojacking?
