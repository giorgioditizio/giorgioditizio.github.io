During my master\u0026rsquo;s degree, I joined the Information Security and Cryptography Group at CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security under the supervision of Dr. Robert KÃ¼nnemann. I received my M.Sc. in computer science from the University of Trento in 2018 with a thesis on Drive-by Download attacks.\nMy research interests lie in the broad area of network and web security with a focus on risk analysis of Advanced Persistent Threats. The gist of my research is to understand factors that drive their behaviors, to model these adversaries, and to identify appropriate mitigations. I collect and analyze targeted campaigns to build a structured and public database of APT campaigns that can be used to study TTPs and adversaries characteristics, their evolution, and the effectiveness of countermeasures (software patching, IDS, etc.).\n","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":1609459200,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"","section":"authors","summary":"Hi!

This work proposes a novel formal model that describes the foundations on which the visible process of data sharing behaves in terms of the network configurations of the Internet (included CDNs, shared cookies, etc.). From our model, we define relations that can be used to evaluate the impact of different privacy mitigations and determine if websites should comply with privacy regulations. We show that the calculus, based on a fragment of intuitionistic logic, is tractable and constructive: any formal derivation in the model corresponds to an actual tracking practice that can be implemented given the current configuration of the Internet. We apply our model on a dataset obtained from OpenWPM to evaluate the effectiveness of tracking mitigations up to Alexa Top 100.","tags":null,"title":"A Calculus of Tracking: Theory and Practice","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Giorgio Di Tizio","Fabio Massacci","Luca Allodi","Stanislav Dashevskyi","Jelena Mirkovic"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1598918400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1598918400,"objectID":"e41fbf2a9d2fbe28685024ad1f0fed4b","permalink":"","publishdate":"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"","section":"publication","summary":"Current approaches to estimate the risk of compromise are based on either historical data or pure technical assessments, such as the number and severity of vulnerabilities in the target network. We propose a novel experimental approach for estimating the risk of compromise based on experimental data, as opposed to observational data, by leveraging on cyber ranges and capture the flag exercises. We identify the key design principles in terms of response and explanatory variables, specification of how they can be measured, and the overall block design from related experiments and approaches as well as assess their suitability and limitations.","tags":null,"title":"An Experimental Approach for Estimating Cyber Risk: a Proposal Building upon Cyber Ranges and Capture the Flags","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Giorgio Di Tizio","Chan Nam Ngo"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1598918400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1598918400,"objectID":"ae69be8b8a3fa1545150da07038945d6","permalink":"","publishdate":"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"","section":"publication","summary":"Illicitly hijacking visitors' computational resources for mining cryptocurrency via compromised websites is a consolidated activity. Previous works mainly focused on large-scale analysis of the cryptojacking ecosystem, technical means to detect browser-based mining as well as economic incentives of cryptojacking. So far, no one has studied if certain technical characteristics of a website can increase (decrease) the likelihood of being compromised for cryptojacking campaigns. In this paper, we propose to address this unanswered question by conducting a case-control study with cryptojacking websites obtained crawling the web using Minesweeper. Our preliminary analysis shows some association for certain website characteristics, however, the results obtained are not statistically significant. Thus, more data must be collected and further analysis must be conducted to obtain a better insight into the impact of these relations.","tags":null,"title":"Are You a Favorite Target For Cryptojacking?
